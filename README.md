The purpose of creating this repository is generally for education; I have never used Git before and need to learn.

At the same time, I am working on a project that involves designing a custom malloc function in c that will dynamically 
allocate and deallocate memory. The only file I am permitted to alter is mm.c. The efficiency is tested by running ./mdriver -v
after untarring the testdriver tarball in the specified directory.
